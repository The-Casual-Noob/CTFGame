Issues:
GENERAL
-Add array storage of obstacles and universal collision detection system
-Add additional comments
-Make private anything that does not need to be public
-Remove debug code

class CTFGame
-NullPointerExceptions appear in CTFGame highScores() and createHighScore() when comparing input to null value. Find another default state for files
-add errorchecking to all inputs
-add graphics to splashScreen(), mainMenu()
-When running in eclipse, cannot find file without specifying full path for createHighScores() and highScores().
	Replace with only the file name when running

class SplashScreen
-add animations

class GameClock
-No issues as of yet
	Note: this class basically acts as a replacement for getSystemTimeMillis() since we haven't learned it

class Player
-

class Display
-

Note: class and thread structure works
